Rembrandt Art Gallery.

Welcome to the Rembrandt Art Gallery, a project dedicated to exploring the life and works of the legendary Dutch artist Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn. Here, you can learn about Rembrandt and view his incredible prints, drawings, and canvas paintings.

The site was built using Bootstrap, which provides a dynamic and responsive user experience. You can navigate through the gallery to see all of Rembrandt's works and read more about his life and artistic style.

One of the standout features of this site is the use of modals. When you click on a painting or drawing, a larger tab will open, showcasing the work in full-screen mode. This allows you to appreciate the details and beauty of each piece without any distractions.

We hope that this project inspires you to learn more about Rembrandt and his incredible body of work. Whether you are a seasoned art lover or a newcomer to the world of art, there is something for everyone in the Rembrandt Art Gallery.

An intersting aspect of the site is that the whole project is contained on one HTML file , each section of the page is linked to the navbar buttons . Soo when you click paintings for example , the page will scroll to that part of the page with a nice animation thanks to a JavaScript function .

Enjoy your visit!!

( I want to credit Pluralsite. I was able to achieve success with this project by following along with courses form Plural Site. I did not create this website on my own. The main objective I set out to accomplish was to showcase my ability to impliment bootstrap ,and create a dynamic website compatible with varios screen sizes and devises. )
